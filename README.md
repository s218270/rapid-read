The application includes customization options, accessibility features, and exciting plans for AI-driven enhancements.

### Features

#### 1. Bionic Reading

Bionic Reading is a reading technique that highlights the first halves of words, allowing your eyes to recognize and comprehend words faster. By focusing on critical letters, Bionic Reading helps the user reduce cognitive load and process text more efficiently. With Rapid-Read, you can experience Bionic Reading with full customization for font size, style, and speed to suit your comfort level.

#### 2. RSVP Reading

RSVP (Rapid Serial Visual Presentation) is a powerful speed-reading tool where individual words flash on the screen in a continuous stream, making it easier for your eyes to process text without jumping between words. Rapid-Read takes RSVP a step further by providing intuitive controls, customizable reading speed, and a sleek, minimalistic design.

#### 4. Future Plans
